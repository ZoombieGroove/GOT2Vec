# GOT2vec
I created a word to vector model.
I used Game of Thrones dataset from the 1 and 2 books-"A Song of Ice and Fire"
This model is used for learning vector representations of words, called "word embeddings".
The motivation: To identify similarity and correlation between different words in the corpus.
